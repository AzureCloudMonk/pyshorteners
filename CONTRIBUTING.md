CONTRIBUTING to pyshorteners
============================

First of all, thanks for your intention to help with this project. It was built while i was learning some python magic features and it really makes me happy that you also want to be part of this.

Some steps to make our lives easier:

1. Before start making any code changes, please open an issue or check if your feature/bugfix is already being handled.
2. Please always make your changes on a separated branch, you choose the name of it.
3. Please follow PEP8.
4. Make sure `make test` passes before sending the Pull request.

Thanks for your help and let me buy you a :beer: sometime
